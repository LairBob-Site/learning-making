<h1>Praxis and Practice</h1>

<div class="quotation">
	"Why is it that, in spite of the fact that teaching by pouring in, learning by passive absorption, are universally condemned, that they are still so entrenched in practice? That education is not an affair of "telling" and being told, but an active constructive process, is a principle almost as generally violated in practice as conceded in theory. Is not this deplorable situation due to the fact that the doctrine is itself merely told? But its enactment in practice requires that the school environment be equipped with agencies for doing ... to an extent rarely attained."

<p>Over the past couple of years, I've become increasingly dedicated to brewing beer at home with a good friend of mine. At first, you would <em>think</em> that the biggest benefit of that hobby would be lots of great, cheap beer on tap. (And that part <em>is</em> awesome.) The absolute best part, though? A hands-on education in chemistry, physics, fluid mechanics and history.</p>

<h3>Need. Learn. Solve.</h3>

<p>The best hobbies force us into a continuous cycle of frustration and triumph &mdash; victories that can only be achieved by connecting your brain directly to your hands. Homebrewing isn't rewarding because it's so hard &mdash; it's surprisingly easy to brew a decent beer at home &mdash; but because there's always something to improve. Something that you could have done better. Something you could have done faster. Anything that would have gotten you closer to where you really wanted to be.</p>

<h1>Better Bitter Beer, Bitte?</h1>

<p>The "standard" size for a homebrew beer recipe is 5 gallons. Not only is it that a nice, round number, but it's also the upper limit of what you can easily manage on a stovetop. Since my buddy Phil and I always brew together, though &mdash; and we were already using an outside propane burner setup &mdash; we quickly graduated to 10-gallon batches. In principle, that's simple enough. All you have to do is double your recipes, and make sure your vessels are big enough to handle the bigger volume of liquid.</p>

[slider title="The Bitterness Balance"]

<p>There are two important factors that influence the final taste of a beer: bitterness and maltiness (i.e., sweetness).</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>IBUs:</strong> The bitterness of a beer is measured in <strong>International Bitterness Units</strong>, a somewhat arbitrary unit that can only be determined in a lab. When making a beer at home, you can calculate what the final IBUs of your recipe <em>should</em> be, based on your hops, but there's no easy way to measure exactly what it <em>is</em>, in the end.</li>
	<li><strong>OG:</strong> The sugars in a beer are measured by its density, or gravity. Most of the sugars that are initially in a beer will be converted into alcohol, but the density of sugars before fermentation (<strong>Original Gravity</strong>) is a good measure of how malty and sweet the final beer will taste. You can &mdash; and should &mdash; measure the gravity of your beer throughout the brewing process.</li>
</ul>

<p>A well-balanced beer will have an IBU/OG ratio close to 0.5, and beers that are especially bitter will have ratios closer to 1.0. All the recipes we had made were designed to be pretty balanced, usually right around 0.5 or so.
[/slider]

<p>In practice, though, we found we had a consistent challenge &mdash; our bigger batches were continually turning out much more bitter than we had intended. Even when we went back and carefully re-made doubled-up versions of our 5-gallon recipes, the 10-gallon batches were noticeably more bitter, which (technically) is not what's supposed to happen.</p>

<h1>Better Taste Through Chemistry. And Physics.</h1>

<p>After digging around and thinking it through a bit, we started to understand what was going on. The actual issue was pretty simple &mdash; once we were supposed to be done boiling a 10-gallon batch, our beer was still staying much too hot, for much too long.</p>

<p>If you really understand making beer, this is <em>completely</em> obvious. One year later, it's obvious to us now, too, but that's basically my point.</p>

<h3>Hops, Humulones and Isomers</h3>
<p>The underlying cause is the biochemistry of hops. Fresh hops have all the same aromas and flavors we're used to in beer, because those come from the essential oils that the plant produces. On the other hand, they really don't taste very bitter at all, because those bitterness-causing compounds don't exist naturally in the plant.</p>
<p>The hop plant does contain bitter compounds known as <em>humulones</em>, but in their natural state, they're not very soluble in water. At room temperature, you could throw handfuls into your beer, and it wouldn't taste much more bitter. (It would taste <em>different</em>, just not a lot more bitter.) At temperatures closer to boiling water, though, the humulones start to form <em>isomers</em> &mdash; each humulone molecule keeps exactly the same atoms, but the extra energy helps the atoms jump into a different configuration, and that give the molecule new properties.</p>
<p>These new isomers happen to be much more soluble in water, and so they leave the plant and start adding their bitterness to the beer. The formula to predict final bitterness is pretty straightforward. It's basically a function of the natural bitterness of your hops, how much of them you use, and how then long you keep them close to boiling.</p>

<h3>A Lingering Loss</h3>
<p>The compounding factor was the volume of our beer...or, more specifically, the volume-to-area ratio. At this point, most of us are familiar with the geometry of why large mammals like elephants have body temperature issues compared to little mammals like mice &mdash; their heat-producing <em>volume</em> goes up as a cube, while their heat-dissipating <em>surface</em> only increases as a square.</p>

<p>When you allow for the fact that &mdash; thermodynamically speaking &mdash; mammals are pretty much just mobile sacks of warm liquid, it's clear that we face the same issue with beer. When you go from 5 gallons to 10 gallons, the volume of boiling hot liquid goes up as a cube, but the cooling area only grows as a square. It doesn't really matter that it takes longer to heat the beer (because we don't put in the hops till it boils) but it makes a huge difference once you're trying to cool the beer, and you're doing it by sucking the heat through the sides and bottom of the pot. We would take the pot of boiling wort, and dunk it into a bucket of ice and cold water to try, and then constantly stir the beer to cool it down.</p>

    The best part of making great beer? <em>Not</em> making great beer.

<h1>Praxis and Practice</h1>

<div class="quotation">
	"Why is it that, in spite of the fact that teaching by pouring in, learning by passive absorption, are universally condemned, that they are still so entrenched in practice? That education is not an affair of "telling" and being told, but an active constructive process, is a principle almost as generally violated in practice as conceded in theory. Is not this deplorable situation due to the fact that the doctrine is itself merely told? But its enactment in practice requires that the school environment be equipped with agencies for doing ... to an extent rarely attained."

<p>Over the past couple of years, I've gotten increasingly dedicated to brewing beer at home with a good friend of mine. At first, you would <em>think</em> that the biggest benefit of that hobby would be lots of great, cheap beer on tap. (And that part <em>is</em> awesome.) The absolute best part, though? A hands-on education in chemistry, physics, fluid mechanics and history.</p>

<h3>Need. Learn. Solve.</h3>

<p>The best hobbies force us into a continuous cycle of frustration and triumph &mdash; victories that can only be achieved by connecting your brain directly to your hands. Homebrewing isn't rewarding because it's so hard &mdash; it's surprisingly easy to brew a decent beer at home &mdash; but because there's always something to improve. Something that you could have done better. Something you could have done faster. Anything that would have gotten you closer to where you really wanted to be.</p>

<h1>Better Bitter Beer, Bitte?</h1>

<p>The "standard" size for a homebrew beer recipe is 5 gallons. Not only is it that a nice, round number, but it's also the upper limit of what you can easily manage on a stovetop. Since my buddy Phil and I always brew together, though &mdash; and we were already using an outside propane burner setup &mdash; we quickly graduated to 10-gallon batches. In principle, that's simple enough. All you have to do is double your recipes, and make sure your vessels are big enough to handle the bigger volume of liquid.</p>

[slider title="The Bitterness Balance"]

<p>There are two important factors that influence the final taste of a beer: bitterness and maltiness (i.e., sweetness).</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>IBUs:</strong> The bitterness of a beer is measured in <strong>International Bitterness Units</strong>, a somewhat arbitrary unit that can only be determined in a lab. When making a beer at home, you can calculate what the final IBUs of your recipe <em>should</em> be, based on your hops, but there's no easy way to measure exactly what it <em>is</em>, in the end.</li>
	<li><strong>OG:</strong> The sugars in a beer are measured by its density, or gravity. Most of the sugars that are initially in a beer will be converted into alcohol, but the density of sugars before fermentation (<strong>Original Gravity</strong>) is a good measure of how malty and sweet the final beer will taste. You can &mdash; and should &mdash; measure the gravity of your beer throughout the brewing process.</li>
</ul>

<p>A well-balanced beer will have an IBU/OG ratio close to 0.5, and beers that are especially bitter will have ratios closer to 1.0. All the recipes we had made were designed to be pretty balanced, usually right around .
[/slider]

<p>In practice, though, we found we had a consistent challenge &mdash; our beers were continually turning out much more bitter than we had intended. Even when we went back and carefully re-made some of our 5-gallon recipes, the 10-gallon versions were noticeably more bitter.</p>
